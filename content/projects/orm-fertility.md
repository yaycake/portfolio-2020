### A New Beginning in China

ORM Fertility was laying down roots in Shanghai; as they looked to grow their marketing arm independent of local partners, they wanted a way to take ownership over their community. Building a WeChat Mini Program would provide them a direct way to market their services in the WeChat ecosystem; it would significantly decrease friction for people to share information on ORM as well as provide valuable  insights and analytics.

### Product Design

ORM Fertility already had a WeChat Official Account, so I had to work with them to figure out how the mini program would fit in with their current marketing workflow and team resources. We went through a discovery phase, where I provided examples of different information-heavy mini programs and illustrated certain strengths and weaknesses of the mini program framework. We coasted through three user experience design rounds and user interaction design rounds.

### Front End Development

One of the most exciting phases of the project is where I take my designs and step into the front-end developer role to bring them to life. Working in the WeChat IDE, the framework has evolved with "React" features, so I organized all the front-end code into functional and higher-order components.
